00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:06.555
This demonstration showcases

2
00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:10.835
how IBM Apptio Costing Standard can help clients translate

3
00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:14.555
data-driven insights to optimize costs and fund innovation.

4
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.275
Clients can elevate their technology, business management

5
00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:22.275
or TBM practices with a highly customizable platform

6
00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:23.635
that can ingest

7
00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.315
and structure data from virtually any source system

8
00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.275
and deliver fully consumptive allocations,

9
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.115
allowing their organization to understand the total cost

10
00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:37.515
of ownership and better manage overall tech consumption.

11
00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:40.875
The demo flows across the application review

12
00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:43.035
and reporting capabilities of the product.

13
00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:45.595
This demo showcases to clients

14
00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:49.115
how they can understand the fully burdened total cost

15
00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:53.555
of ownership of their applications, services, and products.

16
00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.475
The demo begins with the selection

17
00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:59.915
of an application salesforce.com to examine.

18
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:04.755
By using IBM Apptio costing standards robust reporting

19
00:01:04.755 --> 00:01:08.075
capabilities, the client can easily visualize the

20
00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:09.115
application spend.

21
00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:10.835
This demo focuses

22
00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.835
and drills into the application's addressable spend.

23
00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:18.115
Addressable spend allows companies to actively take control

24
00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:20.675
of their bottom line by optimizing

25
00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:23.595
and rationalizing their spend to better align

26
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.195
with strategic priorities.

27
00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:29.075
Typically, addressable spend are the costs

28
00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:32.475
that can be realized in the next six months to a year.

29
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.355
Individual business units are examined to determine

30
00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.035
how they are consuming IT, resources like an application,

31
00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:42.435
and if they are maximizing its use.

32
00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:47.075
The second section examines direct savings, which is a type

33
00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:48.155
of addressable costs.

34
00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.235
A direct savings scenario is explored

35
00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.395
by turning off a portion of a client's cloud infrastructure.

36
00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:59.235
Turning off cloud infrastructure has a ripple effect when

37
00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:00.915
servers and storage are shut down.

38
00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:02.755
The reporting capabilities

39
00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.555
of the Apptio costing standard are used

40
00:02:05.555 --> 00:02:07.835
to examine the effectiveness of this scenario.

41
00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:12.995
This demonstration opens in the service costing tab

42
00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.075
of the homepage.

43
00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:16.875
Click on either applications link,

44
00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:18.315
the one in the left navigation,

45
00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:20.315
or the one in the main body of the page.

46
00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:24.795
This opens the applications report section.

47
00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:28.715
This report shows a high level executive summary

48
00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:30.795
of a client's top applications.

49
00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:36.355
From a visualization perspective, clients can see

50
00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:38.195
where they are spending the most money.

51
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:41.075

where the most money is spent.

54
00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:48.755
In the demo environment.

55
00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:51.235
It is the salesforce.com application

56
00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.755
where the client is spending the most money.

57
00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:58.015
Clients can also see

58
00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:00.485
how their application spend trends over time

59
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:02.325

and the application investment objective are shown.

67
00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:27.775
The addressable spend is the spending

68
00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.775
that can be looked at in the next six months to a year.

69
00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:34.575
Scroll to the right to view the addressable YTD section.

70
00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:39.045
Okay. Clients can drill down

71
00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.725

for salesforce.com provides robust information

76
00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:56.275
about this application.

77
00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:59.995
The top view shows summary, year to date, totals

78
00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:03.315
for app run, app dev, and addressable cost.

79
00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:07.355
There are six tabs that clients can use to drill down

80
00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.795
to view specific information for the application.

81
00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:16.885

82
00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:18.725
in the application details table.

83
00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:22.205
The summary tab shows how the app dev

84
00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:24.845
and app run spend are trending over time.

85
00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:29.325
The addressable costs tab allows a client

86
00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:32.085
to quickly see the percentage of the addressable cost

87
00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:36.165
as cost avoidance, year to date, direct savings, year

88
00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:39.165
to date, or non-addressable cost year to date.

89
00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:42.925
They can also see the addressable trend across direct

90
00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:44.565
savings, cost avoidance,

91
00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:47.525
non-addressable cost or delayed savings.

92
00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:50.845
Mouse over the graphics to view the details in each chart.

93
00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:54.485
The business driver tab allows the client

94
00:04:54.825 --> 00:04:58.165
to look at the trailing 12 month average annual unit

95
00:04:58.235 --> 00:04:59.525
cost for the application.

96
00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:02.005
Clients can also set a target

97
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.365
to see if they're trending towards their goal.

98
00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:08.805
Over time, the user's tab shows information on

99
00:05:08.805 --> 00:05:11.245
application user count, as well

100
00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:13.045
as average annual spend per user,

101
00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:15.165
and average monthly spend per user.

102
00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:20.125
This example shows an upward trend from December fiscal year

103
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:23.405
2022 to March fiscal year 2023

104
00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:25.925
for the average annual spend per user

105
00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.405
and average monthly spend per user.

106
00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:34.805
In the related projects tab, clients can see the projects

107
00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:38.685
that are related to the salesforce.com application along

108
00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:41.525
with their current status and associated costs.

109
00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:48.605
The business unit consumption tab shows which groups are

110
00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:51.205
consuming the application and influencing the business.

111
00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:55.165
The table shows the cost has been shared across three

112
00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:56.485
departments or business units.

113
00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:00.165
It appears that finance's usage has remained steady

114
00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:04.605
but low across the 12 month period, so this may be a case

115
00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:07.485
to communicate to the finance team to migrate

116
00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:10.525
to another application or retire this application.

117
00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:13.085
Thereby reducing unnecessary expenditure

118
00:06:13.545 --> 00:06:16.245
and ensuring financial resources are utilized

119
00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:18.085
where they deliver the most value.

120
00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.845
The customer service and sales

121
00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:23.645
and marketing business units are consistent users

122
00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:26.885
of this application and share the cost almost equally.

123
00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.855
To close the app review, detail dialogue, click on close

124
00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:38.305

130
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.125
The trend chart provides a rolling 12 month trend view

131
00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.005
of each application, family

132
00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:04.165
mouse over any square point on a line

133
00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:06.565
to see the monthly spend for an application.

134
00:07:06.565 --> 00:07:11.445
Family Apptio costing standard A

135
00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:13.125
allows companies to shift

136
00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:15.485
to fully consumptive cost allocations,

137
00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:19.725
providing deeper insight into the fully burdened total cost

138
00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:23.445
of ownership for their apps, services, and products.

139
00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:26.325
In this section, the seller begins

140
00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:28.525
by working in the application review report.

141
00:07:29.255 --> 00:07:30.445
There are other collections

142
00:07:30.445 --> 00:07:34.165
that can help a client focus on the areas that build up

143
00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:35.805
to the costs of their applications.

144
00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:40.525
This section looks at addressable costs,

145
00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:43.765
which are those items that the company can directly

146
00:07:43.765 --> 00:07:44.885
influence and adjust,

147
00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:47.925
and these costs can impact the cost structure

148
00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:49.285
within the next year.

149
00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:52.445
There are different types of addressable costs.

150
00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:54.365
Some are direct savings

151
00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:56.805
because the client can stop using something.

152
00:07:56.865 --> 00:07:59.285
For example, applications, services,

153
00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:02.965
or hardware cloud infrastructure is a good

154
00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:04.165
example of direct savings.

155
00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:06.885
If an application is turned off,

156
00:08:07.115 --> 00:08:10.205
then the client can shut down the associated server in

157
00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:13.045
storage, thus immediately start saving money.

158
00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:16.125
However, if an application is on premises,

159
00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:18.685
typically they are fixed investments

160
00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.205
with depreciated capital investments.

161
00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:24.525
Over time, the client won't see direct savings,

162
00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.285
but they can see them as cost avoidance.

163
00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:29.445
The supporting infrastructure

164
00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:32.445
for the application could be eventually freed up

165
00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:35.245
for other projects in the future without having

166
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:39.725
to buy the infrastructure in the applications window.

167
00:08:40.335 --> 00:08:42.325
Click on the addressable costs tab.

168
00:08:42.985 --> 00:08:44.965
The window opens in a summary view

169
00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:47.165
with several high level charts.

170
00:08:49.315 --> 00:08:52.025
Click on the application family impacts tab.

171
00:08:52.525 --> 00:08:55.485
The window displays a six month trend chart.

172
00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:58.765
Year to date impacts by application family chart,

173
00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:04.205
and a details chart drill into the finance application

174
00:09:04.205 --> 00:09:06.725
family because it has a significant amount

175
00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:07.765
of addressable cost.

176
00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:11.485
The finance panel opens with several charts

177
00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:14.365
and tables that allow clients to understand

178
00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:16.565
what is consumptive and what is not.

179
00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:20.485
Review all the applications within the finance application

180
00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:24.565
family with, eliminate application investment objective,

181
00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:27.285
and then examine the potential business impact

182
00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:28.805
of eliminating the application.

183
00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:31.445
In the details table,

184
00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:34.805

Change the grouping of data to show addressable

369
00:18:51.265 --> 00:18:52.745
and non-addressable costs.

370
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:57.105
Click the group, buy dropdown, expand account,

371
00:18:57.525 --> 00:18:58.865
and then select addressable

372
00:18:58.885 --> 00:19:00.545
or non-addressable from the list

373
00:19:03.015 --> 00:19:04.635
in the spend breakdown chart,

374
00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.635
click on the addressable column.

375
00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:15.035
The spend trend chart is updated to show addressable costs

376
00:19:15.215 --> 00:19:17.475
by month with the forecast in orange

377
00:19:17.735 --> 00:19:22.515
and actuals in red charted, clients may want to pivot

378
00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:24.835
and see addressable and non-addressable data.

379
00:19:24.935 --> 00:19:29.435
For vendors in the spend trend chart, click the dropdown,

380
00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:32.435
expand vendor and select name from the list.

381
00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:37.135
The spend trend chart displays all the vendors

382
00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:38.695
that are considered addressable.

383
00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.855
Drill down to see the details

384
00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:45.015
for point B consultant shown in blue

385
00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:47.415
for January fiscal year 23,

386
00:19:48.235 --> 00:19:50.975
locate the Jan fiscal year 23 column.

387
00:19:51.465 --> 00:19:53.735
Click on the blue block on the top of the bar.

388
00:19:56.875 --> 00:19:58.235
A chart with the addressable costs

389
00:19:58.235 --> 00:20:00.675
for point B consulting is displayed.

390
00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:07.995
Close the chart. This section gives a basic

391
00:20:07.995 --> 00:20:11.835
understanding of IBM Apptio planning, providing clients

392
00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:13.235
with a view of their spending.

393
00:20:14.175 --> 00:20:16.395
In many businesses, viewing financial data

394
00:20:16.455 --> 00:20:19.795
by department is common and familiar to most people.

395
00:20:20.225 --> 00:20:23.635
However, it is best practice to view costs as addressable

396
00:20:23.635 --> 00:20:24.675
and non addressable.

397
00:20:25.415 --> 00:20:27.115
The terms refer to spending

398
00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:29.475
that clients can control in the short term

399
00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:31.275
addressable and spending.

400
00:20:31.275 --> 00:20:32.915
That may take longer to analyze

401
00:20:33.135 --> 00:20:34.795
and see the impact of decisions.

402
00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:38.755
Non-ad addressable Clients can also pivot

403
00:20:38.815 --> 00:20:41.795
and utilize the vendor name view, which allows them

404
00:20:41.795 --> 00:20:44.675
to easily see vendors that are deemed addressable.

405
00:20:45.425 --> 00:20:48.005
Addressable vendors are those that can be examined

406
00:20:48.005 --> 00:20:49.725
and used to drive optimizations

407
00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:51.765
or cut costs for the company.

408
00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:55.685
The vendor point B consulting is revisited

409
00:20:55.685 --> 00:20:56.925
later in this demonstration.

410
00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:01.525
In this section, the seller works

411
00:21:01.525 --> 00:21:03.485
with a pre-configured forecast plan

412
00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:06.525
and compares it to the plan from the previous section.

413
00:21:07.765 --> 00:21:09.245
A forecast plan is useful

414
00:21:09.245 --> 00:21:12.085
because clients can create a view based on several different

415
00:21:12.185 --> 00:21:15.405
use cases such as labor vendors or projects.

416
00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:18.405
This section examines those three use cases.

417
00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:21.485
Begin by examining a pre-configured plan.

418
00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:28.085
Expand the side menu, expand plan, then select plans.

419
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:33.045
In the plans table. Click on fiscal year 2023.

420
00:21:33.175 --> 00:21:35.125
April forecast, WIP.

421
00:21:36.385 --> 00:21:40.125
The plan opens in the expenses window. In the summary tab.

422
00:21:43.285 --> 00:21:46.485
A pre-configured forecast plan is included in this demo.

423
00:21:47.135 --> 00:21:49.365
Users could configure a forecast plan,

424
00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:51.285
but this one is used for convenience.

425
00:21:52.115 --> 00:21:55.565
Upon selecting the forecast plan, you will see opex

426
00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:58.205
and CapEx summarized at the top of the screen.

427
00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:01.805
The total for each is in the large font.

428
00:22:02.785 --> 00:22:05.045
The target is in a smaller font.

429
00:22:05.515 --> 00:22:07.845
Clients can think of target as their goal

430
00:22:07.905 --> 00:22:09.005
for reducing spend.

431
00:22:11.945 --> 00:22:15.405
The demo environment is read only the user permission.

432
00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:17.805
Settings in the demo environment do not allow for users

433
00:22:17.825 --> 00:22:20.285
to adjust the labor and vendor cost.

434
00:22:21.115 --> 00:22:23.125
However, in the client environment,

435
00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:26.685
sellers could adjust the labor costs by identifying areas

436
00:22:26.825 --> 00:22:30.005
to trim costs, reduce headcount for specific roles

437
00:22:30.105 --> 00:22:33.765
or locations, and work toward reducing external labor costs

438
00:22:34.185 --> 00:22:36.645
to meet the target for this forecast plan.

439
00:22:37.905 --> 00:22:41.725
In this section, sellers can help clients review the impact

440
00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:44.485
of the adjustments made to labor vendors

441
00:22:44.665 --> 00:22:47.205
and projects made on overall headcount.

442
00:22:47.225 --> 00:22:51.685
In financials, IBM Apptio planning allows clients

443
00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:53.525
to see the impact of their decisions

444
00:22:53.785 --> 00:22:55.325
and forecasts in real time.

445
00:22:56.235 --> 00:22:59.685
Clients can run forecasts with different use cases

446
00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:02.765
to simulate driving out costs from the business.

447
00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:05.645
In the next five subsections,

448
00:23:06.035 --> 00:23:09.645
examine the results on headcount, overall financials,

449
00:23:10.025 --> 00:23:14.085
vendor financials, project financials, and resource types.

450
00:23:17.225 --> 00:23:21.445
Switch to the summary view. Click on the menu select plan.

451
00:23:22.155 --> 00:23:24.485
Then click on summary from the option list.

452
00:23:27.435 --> 00:23:30.905
Start by looking at the headcount grouped by employee type.

453
00:23:31.445 --> 00:23:34.425
Recall that employees are either internal or external.

454
00:23:35.395 --> 00:23:38.505
Click on the headcount tab. Click on the group.

455
00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:41.985
Buy dropdown, select employee type from the list.

456
00:23:42.895 --> 00:23:46.045
This provides a clear understanding of resource allocation

457
00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:49.005
between internal and external employees.

458
00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:51.765
Compare the headcount

459
00:23:52.105 --> 00:23:54.965
to the budget targets from earlier in the demonstration.

460
00:23:56.805 --> 00:23:58.555
Click on the compare to dropdown.

461
00:23:59.095 --> 00:24:02.235
Select fiscal year 2023 April, budget forecast.

462

New from the list.

463
00:24:04.655 --> 00:24:07.155
Scroll down to the headcount waterfall chart.

464
00:24:08.085 --> 00:24:09.955
There may not be a big change,

465
00:24:10.255 --> 00:24:12.715
but notice the trend of the number of internal

466
00:24:12.775 --> 00:24:14.715
and external resources for the year.

467
00:24:15.505 --> 00:24:19.235
Understanding these trends helps in forecasting future

468
00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:22.155
staffing needs, and budgeting accurately.

469
00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:26.995
Mouse over the internal and external columns in the chart.

470
00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:32.155
To view comparative budget numbers, pivot the data

471
00:24:32.175 --> 00:24:34.875
to view the internal and external labor cost pools.

472
00:24:35.295 --> 00:24:38.115
Switch to a financial view and group by cost pool.

473
00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:42.195

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:46.715
and select cost pool from the list.

476
00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:52.795
Click on set filters and select cost pool from the list.

477
00:24:53.685 --> 00:24:55.715
Check external labor and internal labor,

478
00:24:56.055 --> 00:24:57.955
and click the update filters button.

479
00:25:00.745 --> 00:25:04.035
View the impact of the adjustments made to labor vendors

480
00:25:04.255 --> 00:25:06.555
and projects on overall financials.

481
00:25:07.545 --> 00:25:09.795
This can be viewed on the spend trend chart

482
00:25:10.145 --> 00:25:12.915
that the changes made earlier have had an impact on the

483
00:25:12.985 --> 00:25:14.635
actuals for the first three months of the year.

484
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:19.075
The red line. Seeing these impacts enables quick

485
00:25:19.395 --> 00:25:21.675
identification of cost saving opportunities

486
00:25:22.095 --> 00:25:23.515
and budget optimization.

489
00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:31.875
and final budgets

490
00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:35.915
that indicates external costs affecting the bottom line have

491
00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:37.395
been driven out of the company.

492
00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:40.915
Switch to a vendor centric view.

493
00:25:41.455 --> 00:25:42.955
Remove the cost pool filter

494
00:25:43.095 --> 00:25:45.595

00:26:05.115 --> 00:26:06.555
of spend for each vendor.

502
00:26:07.215 --> 00:26:10.315
The spend trend chart shows the rolled up totals

503
00:26:10.315 --> 00:26:11.555
for all vendors by month.

504
00:26:11.845 --> 00:26:13.715
Along with an actuals line

505
00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:18.555
examine if any adjustments were made to a work item assigned

506
00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:22.355

Trend chart changes to show details for the vendor.

510
00:26:31.895 --> 00:26:35.395
Notice the actuals line, which reflects the changes made

511
00:26:35.395 --> 00:26:37.075
to the money committed to this vendor.

512
00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:42.155
Examine the impact on project financials based on whether a

513
00:26:42.155 --> 00:26:46.365
project is categorized as run, grow, or transform.

514
00:26:47.385 --> 00:26:49.325
Switch to a product-centric view.

515
00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:53.645

The reductions shown is run

521
00:27:10.865 --> 00:27:12.285
and the final budget numbers

522
00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:14.845
that reflect the reductions in run costs.

523
00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:19.885
Another common perspective is to look at the impact

524
00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:22.765
of resource type to see the non-labor

525
00:27:22.985 --> 00:27:25.845
and labor breakout across the entire budget.

526
00:27:26.905 --> 00:27:28.765
Switch to a product centric view.

527
00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:31.365

00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:37.565
There are two resource types, non-labor and labor.

530
00:27:38.305 --> 00:27:40.485
Scroll down to the spend waterfall chart.

531
00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:44.725
Users can see the original budget baseline, the amount

532
00:27:44.725 --> 00:27:46.085
of non-labor removed,

533
00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.045
and the final budget numbers

534
00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:50.805
that reflect the change in non-labor costs.

535
00:27:52.225 --> 00:27:53.965
Here's a quick recap of this demo.

536
00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:58.485
You were able to see how IBM Apptio planning helps clients

537
00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:03.565
consume, transform, and classify data into usable formats.

538
00:28:04.395 --> 00:28:07.725
Clients can begin to understand their current spend,

539
00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:10.485
identify areas where they can optimize

540
00:28:10.865 --> 00:28:12.765
and run scenarios to see the impact

541
00:28:12.765 --> 00:28:14.805
of those changes on the organization.

542
00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:19.685
The demonstration started by reviewing a baseline budget

543
00:28:19.825 --> 00:28:22.085
and comparing it to a set of actuals.

544
00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:25.125
Next, a forecast plan was selected

545
00:28:25.185 --> 00:28:27.805
and compared to the current fiscal year budget.

546
00:28:28.695 --> 00:28:31.525
These two sections were written to familiarize the seller

547
00:28:31.675 --> 00:28:32.805

548
00:28:33.065 --> 00:28:35.925
and other introductory parts of the user interface.

549
00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:39.285
Next, the scenario was created

550
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:42.405
and evaluated for its impact on the forecast plan.

551
00:28:43.105 --> 00:28:46.165
The scenario was comprised of adjustments made

552
00:28:46.165 --> 00:28:48.405
to labor vendor and project data.

553
00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:51.565
Finally, the demonstration illustrated how

554
00:28:51.565 --> 00:28:55.445
to examine the impact of the adjustments at deeper levels,

555
00:28:56.075 --> 00:28:59.805
headcount, overall financials, vendor financials,

556
00:29:00.035 --> 00:29:02.765
project financials, and resource types.

557
00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:05.135
Throughout this demo,

558
00:29:05.565 --> 00:29:08.975
sellers saw the different ways IBM Apptio brings value

559
00:29:08.975 --> 00:29:11.175

560
00:29:11.755 --> 00:29:13.415
giving clients the ability

561
00:29:13.715 --> 00:29:16.575
to start focusing on more value centric activity.

562
00:29:17.545 --> 00:29:20.335
Users in various roles provide inputs,

563
00:29:20.555 --> 00:29:22.255
but with IBM Apptio Planning

564
00:29:22.965 --> 00:29:25.415
plan versioning helps control those inputs

565
00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:27.215
and allows data to roll up quickly.

566
00:29:27.925 --> 00:29:29.655
This process enables clients

567
00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:33.295
to make faster business decisions across their teams.

568
00:29:34.715 --> 00:29:38.015
In conclusion, IBM Apptio planning allows clients

569
00:29:38.075 --> 00:29:39.815
to create scenarios very quickly.

570
00:29:40.785 --> 00:29:44.285
These scenarios help clients understand the impact on their

571
00:29:44.525 --> 00:29:47.885
business and the risks in moving forward on any of those

572
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:50.365
to help get clients moving quickly.

573
00:29:51.005 --> 00:29:53.605

574
00:29:53.945 --> 00:29:55.845
